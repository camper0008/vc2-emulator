## peripherals

### windows

The 'peripherals' feature uses SDL2. To use SDL2, follow the guide described on [Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2#windows-msvc](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2#windows-msvc)

## vc2 extensions

This implementation allows you to write to the vram address location (`0x2034`), if you want to use a double-buffer for rendering.
